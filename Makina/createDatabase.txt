Both of these are specialized features, particularly TSX, which offers programmers the ability to design multithreading applications that scale more effectively than current software—if the CPU supports TSX already. Intel's decision to leave both of these features off of the Intel Core i7-4770K last year drew criticism from enthusiasts who wanted a high-end chip that offered all of Intel's high-end features, but were unable to buy one unless they gave up overclocking support.
